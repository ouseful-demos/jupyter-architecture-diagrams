# jupyter-diagrams
Some diagrams relating to how Jupyter works, maybe?!


Diagrams are created using a variety of techniques:

- using image generators from [blockdiag.com/en/](http://blockdiag.com/en/);
- using the Draw.io editor (available via JupyterLab).

This repository also includes Jupytext, which allows notebooks to be created / edited as markdown files.
